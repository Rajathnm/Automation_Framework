Welcome to Automation, a groundbreaking enhancement of the TestNG framework. This transformative upgrade introduces a multitude of exciting features and capabilities that streamline testing process and enhance your team's productivity.

1.Feature-Driven Testing: Goodbye to complex code. With Automation, we can write test cases in plain English, making them accessible to everyone on the team. No more technical jargon – just simple, user-friendly test scripts.

2.Dynamic Method Creation: Perform basic actions like validation and UI object interaction effortlessly with dynamically generated methods. Simplify your testing workflow and save valuable time.

3.Tag-Based Test Execution: Flexibility of running only the tests you need. Automation allows you to execute test cases based on tags defined in both the test runner and feature files. This precision keeps your testing focused and efficient.

4.Parallel Testing Unleashed:Execute multiple tests concurrently for rapid results,Enhance productivity, and streamline your software release process.

5.Page Object Modeling: Achieve encapsulation and maintainability with ease. Our framework supports a structured Page Object Model, ensuring clean and organized code.

6.Headless Mode: Go headless with any browser using headless mode. Test cases can now run without launching a visible browser, making headless testing a breeze.

7.Cross-Browser Testing: No browser is left behind. Our framework empowers your test cases to run seamlessly in both Firefox and Chrome, giving you comprehensive browser coverage.

8.Webdriver Manager: Say goodbye to manual driver installations. Automation fetches the necessary drivers from your project's dependencies, ensuring you always have the correct driver version, even when they change.

9.Rich Reports: Visualize your test execution with vivid Cucumber and Extent reports, complete with screenshots at every step. These reports serve as invaluable artifacts for tracking and analyzing test results.

10.Smart Test Reruns: Got you covered in case of test failures. Automation includes a dedicated failed test runner. It reruns only the failed test cases, eliminating synchronization-related issues and helping you pinpoint and resolve problems efficiently.

11.Effortless Test Data Management: Simplify test data handling with the ability to store data in property files. Managing your test data has never been this straightforward.

Automation – Taking your testing to the next level with simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency. Experience the future of testing automation today!
